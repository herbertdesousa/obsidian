Be a investor of knowledge
- Invest regularly: Have habit of research something every day
- Diversify: Do not over-know a single topic
- Manage Risk: Learn something hyped, but do not focus only on this, learn also "fundamentals"

Examples:
- Learn a new language every year
- Read technical and non technical books
