A smoker stall (cooking)
Raw answer: I'll be ready 6 p.m.
Full answer: It depends on the stall
	If I wrap it in foil at 160°F (accelerating the process), we eat at **6:00 PM**.
	If I leave it unwrapped for better bark, we eat at **8:00 PM**.

Complete answers allow stakeholder choose between speed and quality.
