Systems has rules! in fact, all of them has some. But there are some rules the needs to be more flexible than others, let's take an example:

###### 0% Flexible | No need (or almost) to change
CPF/CNPJ documents validation
- They are rules that, once done, we will probably not change again.
- Hard coded is enough

###### 100% Flexible | No need (or almost) to change
Credit analysis
- They change always
- May use platform like node-red to make a low-code of the rules

You need to identify them, how much flexible this rule are?
