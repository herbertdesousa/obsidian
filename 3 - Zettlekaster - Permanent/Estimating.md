Estimating a delivery steps:
- **How accurate do you want the answer?** 
	This allow you to be more or less precision, requiring more or less information
- **Understand the problem**
	Understand the domain!
- **Scope matters**
	“Assuming there are no traffic accidents and there’s gas in the car, I should be there in 20 minutes.” - Add the scope to your answer.
- **Accurate answers + Blurred vision = Mental model**
	Zoom in the system you're building, this allows you identify patterns, process and more accurate estimating weren't apparent on the surface.
- **Large estimating sounds breakable**
	If your estimating is too huge, consider to break into small deliveries.[[DDD]] can be helpful.
